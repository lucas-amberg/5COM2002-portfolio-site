        <h3>My True Interest</h3>
        <p>Ever since I was young I have had a profound interest in computers. Only until high school did I realize exactly how I could translate that passion to a career.</p>
        <p>I have been interested in and learning coding and software engineering since then, but only really got focused around Summer 2023.</p>
        <p>The beginning was the most difficult part. Learning the basics, watching tutorial videos, and lots of reading. It was very overwhelming at first, but that is the journey of software engineering.</p>
        <p>Most of my "interests" in software and my technologies are listed to the right, however my biggest interest is learning and trying new things every day as I build projects and write software.</p>

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a career in Web Development, as that is where my skills lie. However, I chose software engineering as my career because of one major reason, which is rapid change. Right now I'm interested in developing websites, but I also have interests in game development and artificial intelligence. My hope is that throughout my career there will be opportunities to try out new career paths and different areas of software engineering as I please and obviously as needed by the industry.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, from the experiences I have had already, it is clear this is something that is possible.</p>
        <p>I am also interested in contributing to open source initiatives. The idea of thousands of people collaborating on technology the whole world uses is outstanding to me, and any opportunity to write code is interesting to me. I haven't leaped at many opportunities for this yet, other than a small few, but I hope to do more as I gain more skills and ability to contribute.</p>
        <p>I look forward to the future and I cannot wait to get involved with the industry in the coming years.</p>
