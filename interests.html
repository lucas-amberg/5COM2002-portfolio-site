        <h2>My True Interest</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was young I have had a profound interest in computers. Only until high school did I realize exactly how I could translate that passion to a career.</p>
        <p>I have been interested in and learning coding and software engineering since then, but only really got focused around Summer 2023.</p>
        <p>The beginning was the most difficult part. Learning the basics, watching tutorial videos, and lots of reading. It was very overwhelming at first, but that is the journey of software engineering.</p>
        <p>Most of my "interests" in software and my technologies are listed to the right, however my biggest interest is learning and trying new things every day as I build projects and write software.</p>
